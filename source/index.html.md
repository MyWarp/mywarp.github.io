MyWarp is an extension for Minecraft's Java Edition that allows players to create and share warps:

- Create public warps, usable by everybody, or private ones, only usable by the creator and invited players.
- Profit from intelligent matching mechanisms that complete warp names while typing.
- Use buttons or pressure plates to access warps.
- Limit the number of warps a user can create: per type and even per world.
- Charge users for creating, managing or using warps.
- Make users wait before or after being teleported.
- Translate or fine-tune every message.

Currenty, MyWarp is avilable for various implementations of the Bukkit API (e.g. [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.com), [Paper](https://aquifermc.org/) and legacy [CraftBukkit](https://bukkit.org)). Support for [Sponge](https://spongepowered.org) is planned.
