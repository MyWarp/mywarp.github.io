## Javadocs
Javadocs are available for each module of MyWarp. They are automatically updated whenever a commit is pushed to GitHub and thus always represent the current development version.

<!-- Note: These files are not included within the Middleman build,
     but are pushed automatically from the MyWarp repo upon build -->
* [mywarp-core](/javadocs/mywarp-core/)
* [mywarp-bukkit](/javadocs/mywarp-bukkit/)
